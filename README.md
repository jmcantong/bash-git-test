# bash-git-test

This is a repository for a workshop hosted by Berkeley's D-Lab, called: *Bash + Git: Introduction*. The purpose of this workshop is to review Bash, and best practices for Github workflows through the command line. For more information on the workshop, feel free to visit the [D-Lab's home page](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/), though I'm not sure that the workshops are open to the public. Despite this, you can find all resources for the workshop, as well as others, in the D-Lab's [repository for the workshop itself](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Bash-Git) and their general [landing page](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley).
